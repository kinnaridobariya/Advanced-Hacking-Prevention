# Advanced Hacking Prevention

This repository contains lab exercises focused on simulating and preventing network attacks using **pfSense** and **Snort**. These labs were conducted as part of an advanced hacking prevention course, covering the setup, configuration, and application of firewall rules and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
